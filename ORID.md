# O
I have learnt the context management in React.

# R
I think context is a good substitution to state when passing state between components.

# I
Understanding context management has made my code cleaner and more maintainable. It reduces the need for prop drilling and makes state management across components more efficient.

# D
Moving forward, I will spend time to learn 3rd party context management tool in React. I will also try to check for states that could be replaced with context in my projects
